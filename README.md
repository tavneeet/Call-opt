# Call-opt
Guess what's the most irritating thing when you're stuck with an issue related to a product and contact the customer service?
Yes, the *Never ending* Waiting time!
'Your call is important to us' - This seems hyporitical, doesn't it? Infact while considering a product, the Customer Support has a high priority after the obvious, Product cost and Quality.
Customer support is supremely important for any company whether it is a Telecom company, Internet  Service Provider, Bank, Insurance company or an E-Commerce Firm. It is the assurance from the company that anything going bad will be resolved as soon as possible.

Thus, here we will try to optimize the Waiting time for one of the channels of Customer Support,i.e, Call Centre.
P.s - A real life call center optimization is far more complex than the one we are considering here. It is a basic solution, where we will be predicting the number of calls everyday so that the company can do the planning accordingly and there is reduction in waiting time, resulting in better expereince for the Customer.
